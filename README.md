To start the website, first clone the repo in your system. Then open the folder in any code editor of your choice.

Use split terminal or open two terminal window.

Use cd webdpfrontend to change your current working directory to the webdpfrontend directory.

run the command npm start. This will download the node_modules folder and will install all the necessary dependencies required.

In another terminal use cd webdpbackend to change your current directory to the webdpbackend directory and run the command node index.js. This will start the database (backend part) over to the mongodb atlas.

Then switch to webdpfrontend terminal and run npm start and boom you will be redirected to http://localhost:3000 which would be the login page of our website.
